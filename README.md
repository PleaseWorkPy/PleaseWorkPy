# Hey there—I'm Alex!

## Who I am
I am first and foremost an Enthusiast. I love finding things that I love to do, and there are a lot of them!
 Hopefully, my repositories will reflect this, where I will be publishing what I can from my research and from my courses.

## What I Do
It is my last year completing my Bachelors of Science in Physics with a concentration in fundamental studies.
 I have also picked up a major in Mathematics and will pick up a minor in statistics if I am able to find the time between now and graduation.
 This has given me a wide variety of experience in pure and applied mathematics.
 Right now this looks like taking abstract algebra and real analysis II while rounding out some research in materials science. 
 If I am not doing any of those things, I am an active member of the Madison Institute for Mathematical Finance and I manage a residence hall.

## What I've Done
I have done research in materials science, where I have a publication coming out soon on the dependence of the crystal structure of MoTe<sub>2</sub> 
on uniaxial pressure in the lattice's c direction. I have done a little bit of work in nuclear and particle physics where
I explored the possibility of research with a given sample with some of our less-accurate detectors (turned out we could not).
During this, I explored the creation of synthetic spectra, which proved to be an interesting challenge. Other than lab work, I have done
coursework that has been highly project based, such as a course where I built a wind tunnel. I have additionally co-found an software company, Vantryx,
that is actively developing an open-source intelligence tool.

## What I'm Doing Soon
I am waiting to hear back fronm graduate school applications. I am very busy working on the HR-side of Vantryx, working as a grader in Solid State physics, 
and working on research in topological data analysis.
