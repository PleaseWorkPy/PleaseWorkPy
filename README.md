# Hey there—I'm Alex!

## Who I am
I am first and foremost an Enthusiast. I love finding things that I love to do, and there are a lot of them!
 Hopefully, my repositories will reflect this, where I will be publishing what I can from my research and from my courses.

## What I Do
It is my last year completing my Bachelors of Science in Physics with a concentration in fundamental studies.
 I have also picked up a major in Mathematics and will pick up a minor in statistics if I am able to find the time between now and graduation.
 This has given me a wide variety of experience in pure and applied mathematics.
 Right now this looks like taking a course in topology and another in mechanics all the while rounding out some research in materials science. 
 If I am not doing any of those things, I am an active member of the Madison Institute for Mathematical Finance and I manage a residence hall.

## What I've Done
I have done research in materials science, where I have a publication coming out soon on the dependence of the crystal structure of MoTe<sub>2</sub> 
on uniaxial pressure in the lattice's c direction. I have done a little bit of work in nuclear and particle physics where
I explored the possibility of research with a given sample with some of our less-accurate detectors (turned out we could not).
During this, I explored the creation of synthetic spectra, which proved to be an interesting challenge. Other than lab work, I have done
coursework that has been highly project based, such as a course where we are building a wind tunnel and another where I am assisting in
the development of a machine-learning based algorithm as a part of a highly multidisciplinary DoD-sponsored course called Hacking for Defense.

## What I'm Doing Soon
I start research in quantitative finance within the next few weeks. I have always been interested in ways to make mathematics—for lack of a better term—"profitable," 
so the notion that I may be able to do what I love while living comfortably is extremely motivating.
Additionally, I am seeking employment in a field that is dynamic, or options for continued studies in mathematics/materials science.
